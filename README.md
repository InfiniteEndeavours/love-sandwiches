- Take daily sales from the user via the terminal and validate it to ensure only numbers have been entered.
- Convert the strings from the input into integers.
- Update the attached Google Sheets workbook 'sales' page.
- Calculate surplus data, by subtracting sales from stock.
- Update the attached Google Sheets workbook 'surplus' page.
- Take the last 5 entries for each item.
- Calculate what the average stock should be for each item, with 10% added.
- Update the attached Google Sheets workbook 'stock' with suggestions on how many of each item should be made.
